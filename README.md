# Project Name

## Project Description
This project is part of the DevOps course and focuses on establishing a professional foundation for the entire project lifecycle. The goal is to develop a functional application baseline while implementing robust project planning, secure repository practices, and a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to ensure code quality.

## Key Features
- **Project Planning & Management**: Utilizes GitHub Project or Azure Board to track milestones and tasks.
- **Secure Repository Setup**: Implements branch protection rules and Git best practices.
- **Application Development**: Baseline version of the application as per the approved proposal.
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and code quality checks via GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines.

## Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your machine.
- Node.js/Python/Other (specify based on your application stack).
- GitHub/Azure DevOps account.

### Steps to Run the Project Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Checkout the Develop Branch**  
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   npm start    # or python app.py, etc.
   ```

5. **Run Unit Tests**  
   ```bash
   npm test     # or pytest, etc.
   ```

## Project Management
- **Project Board**: [Link to GitHub Project or Azure Board](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/projects/1)  
  - Contains detailed User Stories and Tasks for all major milestones (e.g., Containerization, IaC, CD Pipeline).  
  - Tasks for this assignment are broken down and tracked across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).  

---

## Repository Security & Git Workflow
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Enabled on the `main` branch, requiring:  
  - Pull Request (PR) before merging.  
  - At least one reviewer approval.  
  - Passing CI pipeline checks.  
- **Git Workflow**:  
  - `main`: Production-ready code.  
  - `develop`: Integration branch for features.  
  - Feature branches: Created for each task (`feature/your-feature`).  

---

## Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
- **CI Tool**: GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines.  
- **Automated Checks**:  
  - Runs on every Pull Request to `develop` or `main`.  
  - Executes unit tests and code quality checks.  
- **Status Checks**: Required to pass before merging.
